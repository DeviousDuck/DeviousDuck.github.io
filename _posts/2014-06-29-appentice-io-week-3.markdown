This week my mentor and I worked on a previously arranged project for just the 1
week. This isn't the typical work flow in thoughtbot but it was interesting none
the less. I learnt mostly about code spelunking and getting my bearings in an
existing code base. I wrote a few JavaScript heavy features which was tough as I
couldn't get any integration specs to run. The code base isn't well tested and
the client doesn't see the value in testing. As a result we tested everything we
could, but flat out avoided touching anything untested. I felt great because we
left code in a better state then we found it, but could not re factor
aggressively due to the lack of tests.

I spent about three days working on client stuff and interacting directly with
the client. This was awesome as it gave me a real feel for what working at
thoughtbot full time would be like and I loved every minute. The rest of my week
I spent working on switchboard which is an internal project for managing project
work flow. It's an ember application, and I throughly enjoyed getting involved.
There is a stand up every Friday over Google hangouts so everyone is aware of
where the project is heading and who is working on what. This, again, has been
fantastic for getting involved with other thoughtbotters and getting to know the
culture here.

I've gotten most of the way through apprentice patterns and wanted to put down
some of my thoughts. It's a well written book aiming to help one get into the
correct mindset for being a software apprentice. It is not a detailed discussion
of software design, but rather a high level approach to software craftsmanship.
Many of the patterns are, to me, common sense, however, there are definite gems
that make the book worth the read. I think everyone will take different things
away from this book, and some will take more than others, so all I can say is
your mileage may vary. I've been given Design Patterns in Ruby to read next and
I'm looking forward to reading something more directly applicable to code.
