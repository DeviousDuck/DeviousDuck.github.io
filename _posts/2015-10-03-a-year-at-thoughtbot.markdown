[Over a year ago]({% post_url 2014-06-08-apprentice-io %}) I started as an
apprentice at thoughtbot. For those three months I managed to post once a week
about what I'd learned and how things were going. I haven't posted here for a
while, so I thought it was high time for an update.

My first year has been fantastic. There's not a single person in the office I
wouldn't want to be working with. A real highlight has been spending my days
with so many passionate developers, it significantly improves the quality of
life to be around those who enjoy writing code.

Investment time has been a challenge to manage but it feels like something I
have a handle on now. I've written four blog posts for the company blog, on
being [lazy], having [style], willingness to [commit] and on playing [games]. I
wrote an ember addon for [authentication with firebase], and then had it merged
into the official [firebase addon]. This even got me a mention on the [firebase
blog], [twice]!

I've had 4 client projects since finishing my apprenticeship, and have learnt a
shit ton about managing expectations and setting up for success. There have
certainly be high and low points, but I've become far more aware of what needs
to be done. Thankfully, there's plenty of support available from other
thoughtbottles, and all of the projects I've been on have continued forward to
success.
