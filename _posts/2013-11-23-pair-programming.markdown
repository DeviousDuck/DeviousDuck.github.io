Previously, I had mentioned signing up for [thoughtbot's learn prime][learn] and
so far I've completed two of the workshops and tired to be fairly active on the
forums. They're currently experimenting with setting up study groups of 5-10
people to explore programming topics as a group. I joined and the first weeks
exercise was to pair program with someone else in the group. The code in
question was to make the game battleship. I paired with another Englishman and
the experience was pretty awesome. [Here's][battleship] what we came up with and
although its not finished I think we're both pleased with sticking to TDD and
getting this far. The exercise was less about building the application and more
about pairing with someone.

We used [tmate][tmate] to share a terminal and the whole thing was fairly
seamless. We had Skype open to talk to each other and it took us a little while
to readjust to Vim as opposed to Mac Vim but the whole thing was easier then I
has anticipated.

Next I'd like to start using tmux more throughly and maybe move back to command
line Vim... I just need to work out how I'm going to handle all my command
bindings!
