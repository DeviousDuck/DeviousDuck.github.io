I tried using thoughtbots [dotfiles][dotfiles] and their [laptop setup][laptop]. However, I noticed both hadn't updated their brewfile's tap from `tap thoughtbot/rcm` to `tap thoughtbot/formulae`. So I put in a [pull request][pull-dotfiles] or [two][pull-laptop] and my first contribution to opensource was born!
