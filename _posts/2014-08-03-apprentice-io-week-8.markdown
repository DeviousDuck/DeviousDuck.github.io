This was my final week of my second month, next week I start with my new mentor
[JoÃ«l](https://github.com/JoelQ) and start my final month as a thoughtbot
apprentice.

I ordered a mechanical keyboard. There are a couple of developers here using
them and I'd been interested before coming here, but fellow apprentice
[Justin](http://reallybusywizards.com/) (who just got offered a full time
position! Gratz!) introduced me to [massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/home).
They are selling a split layout keyboard that looks awesome. Although the drop
has ended, you can find it [here](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox) to see
what I've gotten myself in for.

I spent Monday through Thursday working on bugs for the client and pairing on
some refactors. All pretty standard stuff although for one refactor we did end
up making a few [query
objects](http://helabs.com.br/blog/2014/01/18/turn-simple-with-query-objects/)
which I've never done before but I liked the pattern. I also spent a little time
on ember projects and spent a fair amount of time working out api-stubs for
testing vs development but I think I may dedicate a post to the topic.

Friday we fleshed out the diplomacy app a bit more. It very exciting working
with a designer as the material he produces seems like wizardry to me. It's nice
showing other developers ember as it's something I'm loving more and more.
