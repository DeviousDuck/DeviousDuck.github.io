The last few weeks have been mercifully relaxed after the pace of thoughtbot's
apprenticeship. I've mostly been working on internal projects and my new
keyboard! This post is in fact being slowly typed on my
[ergo dox](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox). I took a bunch of pictures
during its construction and put them together into a gif for your viewing
pleasure.

This was a super fun project which was made possible only with the help and
expertise of [Tony](https://twitter.com/TonyD256). Here's the finished product:
