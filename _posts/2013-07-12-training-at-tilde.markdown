Next week I'm being sent out to San Francisco for a three day training course in [Ember JS][emberjs] with the lovely people over at [Tilde][http://www.tilde.io/]. One of the really exciting aspects of the course is the fact that the two instructors teaching it are none other then [Yehuda Katz][katztwitter] and [Tom Dale][tomtwitter]. If you didn't already know, both these men are on the core team for Ember. Yehuda is also a huge contributer to rails and is on the [w3c][w3c] which means I should probably take note of anything he has to say on the future of web development.

I'll also be taking a couple of days afterwards to explore more of San Fran. All in all very exciting!
