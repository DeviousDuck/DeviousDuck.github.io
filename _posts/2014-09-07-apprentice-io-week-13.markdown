My last week as an apprentice!

As a new employee, I was asked to go ahead and add my picture and blurb to the
[thoughtbot site](http://thoughtbot.com/people).

It's been a fantastic ride and I'm so excited to get started as a full time
developer. I'm taking a week to spend time with my family but I'm excited to get
back and start as a full time developer.
